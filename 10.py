A liquid ring vacuum pump is needed to maintain a pressure of 75 torr on a degasser that is 
used to strip air from a nonvolatile organic liquid at 150F.
The steady-state air load specification is 35 lb/hr. Water at 60F is 
available as the seal liquid. The pump will discharge to 760 torr.

What would be the standard capacity rating of a pump that meets these requirements?

# Example 10-2

A 2000 gal vessel must be evacuated from the atmospheric pressure to 75 torr
in 10 minutes. Air leakage is 5 lb/hr and the temperature in the vessel is 70F.
If a liquid ring vacuum pump using 60F seal water will be used, select 
a pump that will meet these requirements.

A single-stage liquid ring vacuum pump at 250 torr is 940 ACFM. At this point,
the pump consumes 50 bhp and requires 20 gal/min of 60F seal water.

Determine the dry air pump capacity using acetic acid at 30C as the sealant.

Assume the power and sealant flow requirements are unchanged.

The steam jet evacuating a turbine condensor must be replaced. The jet is not
oversized. It requires a suction pressure of 50 torr under a load of 
70 lb/hr saturated at 92F with 145lb/hr of water vapor. A spare two-stage,
flat-head liquid ring pump with a standard capacity of 600 ACFM at 50 torr is no longer needed in another area.
Can it be used to replace the jet if seal water is available at 70F? Published power and sealant usages
for the pump are 40bhp and 30 gal/min.
