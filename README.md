# Vakyume
# A Python Library for Vacuum Design

Inspired by the 1986 edition of *Process Vacuum System Design and Operation* by James L. Ryans and Daniel L. Roper, this project offers functions related to engineering vacuums. 

We revisit the history of low pressure devices, recreating the example calculations programatically. Furthermore, a supplementary decorator is developed to calculate arbitrary missing values for a given formula. 

In a nutshell, we demonstrate how to take a textbook's equations and turn it into a complete equation solver for all permutations. 

Later, we convert the Python code to C++ for optimization.


# Kwarg Solver Decorator

As long as one keyword argument is not given, its value is calculated

E.g. 
```
@kwarg_solver
def einstein(...):
	"""e = m * c ** 2"""
	return ...

einstein(e = 1000) # returns m, (1000 / 8.98755179 e16), ~1.11265 e -14
einstein(m = 1000) # returns e, 1000 * 8.98755179 e16, ~8.98755179 e19
```
